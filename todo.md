# Outstanding Tasks

* [ ] Finish adding cucumber tests for all the manual testing.
* [ ] Add a new github action step that runs the cucumber steps too
* [ ] Move cucumber help documentation to a separate `docs/cucumber/` directory.  Can I use cucumber for other ruby projects, like the pdk?  How does cucumber compare with other "feature" testing tools?
