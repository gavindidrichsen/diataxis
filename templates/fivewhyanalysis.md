## Problem Statement

Brief description of the issue being investigated.

## Analysis

- Use the evidence-based 5-why methodology; gather concrete evidence at each step to trace the problem from symptom to root cause.
- Use narrative flow investigation embedded error snippets as visual evidence.
- Include the investigation questions and findings at each level, with actual command outputs and error messages.

### Why did the XXXX fail?  (first 5 why question)

- Show the error
- Explain the cause
- Include verifyable evidence to prove the cause using command-line statements or code or links to web research.
- Finally, prompt me before proceeding so that I can agree how to proceed.  Is this root cause enough to end the analysis?  Do I agree with this analysis?  Is there an another 5 why question to ask?

```bash
# Example error evidence or command-line statements to verify the error
