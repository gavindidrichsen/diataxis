## KEYPOINTS

* Add a concise summary here of the context
* Add simple list of steps to achieve the goal of this note. For example, a bulleted list or if it is code or bash command-line work, then add a single ```bash...``` code block with the commands required to either replicate the problem, solve the problem, etc.

## SUMMARY

* Add a more detailed summary with code snippets of logs extracts, etc.
* This section should enhance the KEYPOINTS section.

## TASKS

This section should hold any outstanding tasks that I might want to re-visit. Only if this is relevant. Always ask me if I want to add ones that you propose. If I say to add a task, then add it here.
