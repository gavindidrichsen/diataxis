GTD Philosophy Overview

Getting Things Done (GTD) is a productivity methodology by David Allen designed to reduce 
stress and improve clarity by organizing tasks and commitments into actionable lists.

Core Principles:

1. Capture Everything
   Collect all tasks, ideas, and commitments into a trusted system so nothing stays in your head.

2. Clarify & Organize
   Decide what each item means and where it belongs:
   - Is it actionable?
   - If yes, what's the Next Action?
   - If no, trash it, incubate it, or file it as reference.

3. Next Action Thinking
   Break projects into the very next physical, visible step you can take to move it forward.
   Example: Instead of "Plan website redesign," write "Email designer to schedule kickoff."

4. Project Definition
   A project in GTD is any outcome requiring more than one action. Define:
   - Purpose (Why this matters)
   - Desired Outcome (What "done" looks like)
   - Next Actions (What to do now)

5. Contextual Lists
   Organize actions by context or state:
   - @waiting – tasks dependent on others
   - @backlog – deferred tasks
   - @someday – ideas for the future

6. Review Regularly
   Weekly review ensures clarity and trust in your system.

# Project: {{title}}

## Outstanding Tasks

These are my most pressing **Next Actions**:

**@urgent** tasks:

- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

## Other Lists

These hold my other actions so I can know they're recorded but "forget" about them to reduce cognitive load.

**@waiting** for these tasks:

- [ ] Waiting task 1

**@backlog** tasks for later:

- [ ] Backlog task 1

**@someday** ideas to revisit:

- [ ] Someday idea 1

## Project Purpose

**Why does this project matter?**

Explain the motivation and value this project provides.

## Desired Outcome

**What does "done" look like?**

Describe the concrete end result you're aiming for. Be specific.
